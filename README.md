# EverExploreScrapers

Hello, and welcome to the scrapers we have used to gather quality bike data from large bike retailers around the world. We take bike price data from REI, TREK, and others. To run the scraper, just download the files, and run it in your command prompt. But, before you run it, make sure to download and activate a virtual environment! This scraper is run every week to keep the prices updated on our chart inside our website!

For a video on how these scrapers work, please visit the main website and go to the About page.

Credits to the BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Pandas libraries for helping us create the scrapers.
